# Logging in to compute cluster
  
  We have set up a jupyterhub compute server on which you can run code, in case you do not have sufficient compute resources of your own.
  
  Following the steps here, you should be able to log in to the server, and run code in jupyter notebooks or via the terminal.
  
  * **Step 1**:
  
    Download and install the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client from [LRZ](https://www.lrz.de/services/netz/mobil/vpn_en/anyconnect_en/)
    If the automatic download does not work, you can also manually download the installation files from [here](https://www.lrz.de/services/netz/mobil/vpnclient/)
    
    
  * **Step 2**:
    
    Fire up the VPN-Client and enter your TUM ID and password to connect.

  * **Step 3**:
    Use your favourite browser to navigate to https://bhrigu.cne.ei.tum.de
    At the log-in prompt, enter your TUM ID and password again.
    You should see the following screen:

  * **Step 4**:
  
    You can use the "Upload" button to load data and files to the server.
    
    You can also use the options under "New" to open a new Jupyter notebook ("Python3"), a terminal ("Terminal"), to create new directory ("Folder") or a new file ("Text File").
