# Module 0: 
In week 1, we will introduce the general goals and logistics of the course, and the tools you will need: Jupyter Notebooks, Github, Brian. Please use this week to make sure that you know the basics of working with Github, have access to a working python installation (either on your machine or via jupyterlab) and have basic familiarity with the Brian Simulator.

In order to clone this repository and install required packages, follow the instructions [here](./logistics.md)

This is a simple assignment to introduce the students to GitHub and see if they understood GitHub classroom.

### Content

There are two tasks:
1) write a python function called `add_two_numbers(a, b)` in the file `my_python_script.py`. This function takes in two numbers `a` and `b` and outputs their sum `a+b`.
2) In the same file, write a function called `add_integers_up_to_n(n)` that takes as argument the variable `n` and outputs the sum of all integers until `n` (including `n` itself).

### Submission

Once you have submitted your solution, you should be able to see a progressbar for this assignment. If it is at 100%, your solution is correct.

## (Optional) Using python and jupyter notebooks
For those of you who are unfamiliar with python and jupyter notebooks, or if you need to refresh your memory on either, you could work through materials from the MSNE Fundamentals of Computer Science course taught by Jan-Matthis Lückmann, Artur Speiser and Tamara Müller in WiSe 2019 [here](https://github.com/cne-tum/msne-datascience-2019)
