# Module 0:

## Goals
In week 1, we will introduce the general goals and logistics of the course, and the tools you will need: Jupyter Notebooks, Github, `brian2`. Please use this week to make sure that you know the basics of working with Github, have access to a working python installation (either on your machine or via jupyterlab) and have basic familiarity with the `brian2` Simulator.

## Assignment
The assignment for this week has three parts:
1) Set up your working environment and make sure you are comfortable with using `python`, `git` and `github`. In order to clone this repository, set up your working environment and install required packages, follow the instructions [here](./logistics.md).
2) Familiarize yourself with the `github classroom` environment and complete the programming assignements listed in [Content](#Content).
3) Familiarize yourself with `brian2` by following the instructions [here](./intro_brian2.md).

## Content
There are four tasks. All tasks should be performed on a separate branch in git (i.e. not on `master`)
1) write a python function called `add_two_numbers(a, b)` in the file `my_python_script.py`. This function takes in two numbers `a` and `b` and outputs their sum `a+b`.
2) In the same file, write a function called `add_integers_up_to_n(n)` that takes as argument the variable `n` and outputs the sum of all integers until `n` (including `n` itself).
3) Create a new text file in the `module0` folder and quickly write down how much experience you have with `git` and `python`. We will use this to estimate the average level of students taking the class and to adapt future contents respectively (whatever you write there will have no influence on your grade!)
4) Create a pull request from the branch you are working on onto the `master` branch.

## (Optional) Using python and jupyter notebooks
For those of you who are unfamiliar with python and jupyter notebooks, or if you need to refresh your memory on either, you could work through materials from the MSNE Fundamentals of Computer Science course taught by Jan-Matthis Lückmann, Artur Speiser and Tamara Müller in WiSe 2019 [here](https://github.com/cne-tum/msne-datascience-2019)

## Submission
If the tests are running through on GitHub, your implementation of task 1) and task 2) is correct. The last commit in your repository before the deadline on 3rd of May, 11:59pm will be saved as submission.
