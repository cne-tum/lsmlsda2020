# Module 1: Mechanistic models of decision making

## Goals: 
You will learn how to implement and tune a model of perceptual decision making.
The ‘high-level’ objective will be to understand how to set up neural simulations, but also to get an appreciation of their limitations, as well as their dependence on the parameters/assumptions.

## Week 1 
In week 1, you will get to know `brian` and the implementation of a mechanistic model perceptual decision making.

Tasks: 
- Form a team of up to three members with which you will work on the projects to come. Please note that you will have to stay in this team for the rest of the course!
- Read through background materials 1 - 2.
- Work on exercises 1 and 2.
  - Create your fork of the repository by accepting the [github classroom assignment](https://classroom.github.com/g/6CfgxEtI).
  - Clone your fork to work locally. (Note that you will always work exclusively in your fork / copy of the repository. You will never have to push to this repository (https://github.com/cne-tum/lsmlsda2020/).)
  - Work through the notebook, add code and plots in code cells, add text answer in markdown cells (more details in the notebook).
  - Commit regularly, your last commit before the deadline counts as submission.
