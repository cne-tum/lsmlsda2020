# Module 1: Mechanistic models of decision making

## Goals: 
You will learn how to implement and tune a model of perceptual decision making.
The ‘high-level’ objective will be to understand how to set up neural simulations, but also to get an appreciation of their limitations, as well as their dependence on the parameters/assumptions.

## Week 1 
In week 1, you will get to know the model with which we will working in this project.

Tasks: 
- Read through background materials 1 - 2.
- Work on exercises 1 and 2. 
  - create your fork of the repository by accepting the github classroom assignment
  - work through the notebook, add code and plots in code cells, add text answer in markdown cells. 
  - commit regularly, your last commit before the deadline counts as submission.
