    "# Perceptual Decision Making (Wong & Wang) week 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this exercise we study decision making in a network of competing populations of spiking neurons. The network has been proposed by Wong and Wang in 2006 [1] as a model of decision making in a visual motion detection task. The decision making task and the network are described in the [Neuronal Dynamics by Gerstner - Chapter 16](http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch16.html) and in the original publication (see location-references [1]). Read the introduction of chapter [16, Competing populations and decision making](http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch16.html). To understand the mechanism of decision making in a network, read [16.2, Competition through common inhibition](http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch16.S2.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "To get a better understanding of the network dynamics, we recommend to solve the exercise spatial-working-memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters of our implementation differ from the original paper. In particular, the default network simulates only 480 spiking neurons which leads to relatively short simulation time even on less powerful computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to solve the exercises\n",
    "This weeks's project consists of two exercises. Some of them are solved by writing code and producing plots, so you solve them by just doing that. Other exercises are questions about the behavior of the code or the model, e.g., you will have to interpret a plot you just generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those exercises that require you to write text or math, please write in the notebook cells we provide below the exercise, and please write in markdown format (you can use LaTeX in markdown cells). You enter the cells like code cells with a \"double click\" or \"enter\". \n",
    "\n",
    "You can commit as many times as you want, e.g., after every sub-exercise, or just once when you are done. The final commit before the deadline will be your submission.\n",
