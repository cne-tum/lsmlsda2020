# Module 2: Statistical models for neural dynamics

## Goals: 
In this tutorial we will investigate statistical models for neural dynamics. The focus lies on generalized linear models (GLMs).
You will learn how to calculate the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of neural firing rates and construct LNP models including a spike-history dependet LNP model before moving on to fit an LNP model with MLE.

## Week 4 
Go through the tutorial. Part 1 will give you some practice with the maths. There is no need to include the whole derivation in the results you hand in, but just the final results. (Note that this will most likely be different in the final reports - so if you want to get practice with Markdown/ LaTeX already now, feel free to include everything.)
In part 2 you will construct two different LNP models and will try out different approaches to estimate the convolution filter of a simulated neuron.

We summarised all the logistics you need to take care of in [logistics.md](./logistics.md).
