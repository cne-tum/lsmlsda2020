# Module 2: Statistical models for neural dynamics

## Goals: 
In this tutorial we will investigate statistical models for neural dynamics. The focus lies on generalized linear models (GLMs).
You will learn how to calculate the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of neural firing rates and construct LNP models including a spike-history dependet LNP model before moving on to fit an LNP model with MLE.

## Week 4 
Go through the tutorial. Part 1 will give you some practice with the maths.
In part 2 you will construct two different LNP models and will try out different approaches to estimate the convolution filter of a simulated neuron.
