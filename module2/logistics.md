# Logistics 
The exericises in this module are based on the 

GLM Tutorials from Jonathan Pillow : https://github.com/pillowlab/GLMspiketraintutorial

We provide a set of functions in utils.py (week4) that will be used throughout the tutorials for this module.

You will only need 'numpy', 'matplotlib','scipy' and 'pytorch' (no support GPU needed)
